# TweetBoard
Solana DApp with a React.js frontend which will allow users to submit tweets to a public wall. 
However, submission of tweets is not that easy.
There are some goofy guidelines that need to be followed to submit a tweet.
The guidelines are (poorly) analagous to the way bitcoin works.

To see how it works and submit some tweets:
1) Make sure you have a phantom solana wallet
2) Go to: (url I am hosting at)
3) Login with a phantom solana wallet
4) Read the guidelines
5) Have fun!

This project was based on the following tutorial from buildspace:
