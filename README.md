# TweetBoard
Solana DApp with a React.js frontend which will allow users to submit tweets to a public wall. It is on Solana's devenet.
However, submission of tweets is not that easy.
There are some goofy guidelines that need to be followed to submit a tweet.
The guidelines are (poorly) analagous to the way bitcoin works.

To see how it works and submit some tweets:
1) Make sure you have a phantom solana wallet that is connected to devnet
2) Airdrop some solana tokens to your wallet if needed
3) Go to: (url I am hosting at)
4) Login with a phantom solana wallet
5) Read the guidelines
6) Have fun!

This project was based on the following tutorial from buildspace:
